Some lenders offer fast loans for borrowers with bad credit (629 or lower credit score). If you have bad credit, a low debt-to-income ratio and proof of stable income will help you qualify.

Your credit score doesn't affect how long it takes for a lender to fund your loan, but your loan is likely to have a high APR, and you may not be approved for a large loan amount.

Though many online lenders can fund loans quickly, take the time to compare bad-credit loans before borrowing and make a plan to repay the loan.
