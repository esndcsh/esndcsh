Some federal credit unions can fund personal loans quickly. Alliant Credit Union, for example, funds loans the same day, though youâ€™ll need to become a member before you apply.

Federal credit unions cap annual percentage rates at 18% on personal loans. Credit unions may also use an applicant's history as a member to inform loan decisions, so if you've been in good standing with a credit union for a while, that may be a factor in a loan decision.
