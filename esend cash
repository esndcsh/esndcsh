Before you borrow — and especially if the rate you pre-qualify for is high — see if you can delay the expense or find an interest-free cash source. NerdWallet recommends trying all these cheaper alternatives before taking a high-cost loan:

    Seek assistance from local nonprofits, charities and religious organizations.

    Use a cash advance app to borrow a small amount from your next paycheck.

    Get a pawnshop loan secured by something you own.

    Try other ways to make money.

    If you are comfortable with it, ask family and friends for a loan through lending circles or a loan agreement.
